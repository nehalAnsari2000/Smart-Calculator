# Interactive Command-Line Calculator

This is a Python-based interactive command-line calculator that can perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division), as well as advanced mathematical functions like LCM and HCF. The calculator accepts natural language-like input, making it user-friendly and easy to interact with.

## Features:
- **Basic Operations**: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division
- **Advanced Functions**: LCM, HCF
- **Natural Language Input**: Accepts human-like sentences for operations (e.g., "Add 5 and 10," "What is the LCM of 12 and 15?")
- **Command Recognition**: Handles commands like "NAME," "EXIT," and "HI."
- **Error Handling**: Provides error messages for invalid inputs and operations.
  
## Usage:
- Input mathematical operations or commands in plain text, and the program will process the request.
- Example inputs: "Add 5 and 7," "What is the LCM of 12 and 18?"
- Commands: "EXIT" to quit, "NAME" to display the name of the program.

## Installation:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the Python script in your terminal.
